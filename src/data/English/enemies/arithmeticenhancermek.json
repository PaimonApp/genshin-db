	"description": "A clockwork meka designed to transmit and enhance signals.\nThe power that drives this clockwork meka is generated from a controlled annihilation reaction between ousia and pneuma in the kinetic core. As a result, overloading it with excessive energy will cause its original equilibrium to be disrupted.",
