	"description": "A mimetic life form made out of spores that has extreme adaptability.\nThis creature may look like a bird, but it cannot fly. Due to the influence of Hydro energies, it is astoundingly agile compared to others of its kind. Some research has inferred that this creature is in fact an aggregation of countless tiny spores rather than a single entity.\nThis creature has a position of command amongst colonies of Fungi and exhibits heightened intelligence to match.",

While in either one of said states, the Fungus will drop special materials</color>\\nIt is said the infestation of Fungi is the result of a lab accident. At first, a certain sage had hopes of utilizing spores for medical purposes. If that is true, the person had clearly underestimated the spores' adaptive and reproductive powers."
