Will work for anyone as long as the pay is good.\\n\"The Eremites\" is an umbrella term that people from outside the desert have coined for them. But beneath this name, there are separate entities such as the sellsword group known as the Farrokhzadan and the tribe of Tanit.\\nAs a people led not by gods, most of these desert descendants wield their blades to make a living and offer their skills to those who pay."
