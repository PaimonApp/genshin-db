Though they are called the Nobushi, they do not have a centralized organization.\nThey possess highly-advanced sword skills and also use crossbows to ambush opponents, using any means to win. Those who have abandoned the title of a martial artist often abandon their dignity as well.\nSometimes they even collude with the Treasure Hoarders or Fatui out of a greed for wealth â€” or simply to survive.",
