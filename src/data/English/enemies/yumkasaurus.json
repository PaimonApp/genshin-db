They could roam freely with the wind, cling to the bodies of the massive dragons, or gather in groups to move about like clouds. However, in order to maintain their form after their abilities degenerated, they had no choice but to assume their current shape.",

It is said that after losing their power, they were forced to become ever more dependent on their environments for survival, finally settling into the forms they still have as Saurians today.\\nBut whether this is true or not, no one really knows."
