Sometimes, they'll even fall over to one side just sitting on their tails. However, one day, they will grow into the form that can swing freely between the trees without a care.",

It is said that after losing their power, they were forced to become ever more dependent on their environments for survival, finally settling into the forms they still have as Saurians today.\\nBut whether this is true or not, no one really knows."
