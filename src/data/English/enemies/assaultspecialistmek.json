	"description": "Alongside the Recon Log Mek, this was one of the first new-type clockwork meka to be made (though of course, after hundreds of years, no one refers to them as \"new-type\" anymore – this was simply to differentiate them from traditional clockwork mechanisms that were powered by potential energy.)\nIt was named to commemorate a friend of its inventor, and was originally designed to help people. However, its ability to attack people – thereby avoiding the need to put friendly personnel at risk – subsequently came to be seen as its real strength.",
