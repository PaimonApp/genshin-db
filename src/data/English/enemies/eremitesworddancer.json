Will work for anyone as long as the pay is good.\nThis desert warrior wields a large curved blade in battle. The skills such fighters boast of have been passed down since the days when their now-lost civilization was still extant, and are not only techniques to be used in battle, but also serve well as a performing art popular in various lands.\nIt is said that this sword art was once practiced from horseback.",

But beneath this name, there are separate entities such as the sellsword group known as the Farrokhzadan and the tribe of Tanit.\\nAs a people led not by gods, most of these desert descendants wield their blades to make a living and offer their skills to those who pay."
