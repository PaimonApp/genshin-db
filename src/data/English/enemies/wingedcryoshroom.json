When it flies about, it will scatter icy flowers in its wake. These crystal cores, too, are spores.\nThis creature has a position of command amongst colonies of fungal beasts and exhibits heightened intelligence to match.",

At first, a certain sage had hopes of utilizing spores for medical purposes. If that is true, the person had clearly underestimated the spores' adaptive and reproductive powers."
