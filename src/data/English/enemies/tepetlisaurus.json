When it slept, mountains would form along its back, and when it woke, it would shake off the dirt and rocks, leaving behind gems and jade shining amongst its scales. The huge, drill-shaped objects in the Children of Echoes are said to be the remains of that great drake's large drill-horn.",

It is said that after losing their power, they were forced to become ever more dependent on their environments for survival, finally settling into the forms they still have as Saurians today.\\nBut whether this is true or not, no one really knows."
