It's just like what my father always said — \"When every person in Natlan takes up the responsibility they can shoulder, Natlan will stand strong forever.\" The job is now my duty, and I perform it regardless of my level of personal interest.\n...And on top of that, I was the most skilled among those who studied the craft in the tribe. If I didn't become a Name Engraver, that would mean someone else would have to take it on in my stead. The other students constantly asked me questions and copied my homework. Had it become their job to forge Ancient Names, I'm sure they would constantly come bothering me with questions.
