	"description": "A rare butterflyfish that emits light amidst the pitch-dark ocean. They love to swim in schools, and when gathered together, they form the image of a moon that has fallen into the sea, which is the origin of the \"Lunar Leviathan\" legend. This characteristic once attracted a great number of light-seeking sea creatures, and in some sense, also guided people who had descended into darkness.",
