	"description": "Humanity's best friend!\nThis canine breed sports three-colored fur, a result of many bloodlines mixing. Specimens of this species are strong and more intelligent than most, and thus are often kept as pets or work dogs.\nIt is said, however, that Chestnut Hunting Hounds will show a lazier, more gluttonous side to themselves when not given orders by their master. Most notably, they never refuse offers of food, resulting in upset stomachs and owners alike.",
