	"description": "A small songbird commonly found in Fontaine that sings pleasant melodies.\nIt is said that Bluecrown Finches are very sensitive to the outside world, willing to abandon their nest and flee at the slightest whiff of trouble. As such, folklore describes these timid finches as portents of disaster, for when they begin to hurriedly flee, that means ruination must not be too far behind.",
