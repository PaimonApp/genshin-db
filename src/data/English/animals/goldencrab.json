	"description": "A claw-snapping crab that can be found in various water bodies throughout Teyvat.\nThis golden-shelled crab is especially tasty, and is the star of the show in the famed Liyue dish known as Golden Crab.\nSome people call those who run amok as they please \"crabs,\" but a crab's manner of movement is not so much a matter of their character as it is their physical makeup. Such monikers are most unfair to crab-kind.",
