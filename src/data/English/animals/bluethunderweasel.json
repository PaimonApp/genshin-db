	"description": "These intelligent weasels live underground within the mining tunnels and caverns depths of The Chasm. Their fur has a unique blue sheen.\nHaving long become used to life in the darkness, they now have excellent hearing and olfactory senses.\nTheir jade-colored eyes and unusual fur have led miners to see them as an omen that gemstones are to be found nearby.
