	"description": "A small, round bird that is a distant relative to Fontainian Finches. The name Umbrellafinch comes from the mushroom-parasol like, unique-looking feathered crest they possess.\nResearch indicates that the Burgundy Umbrellafinches are poor fliers and find it hard to evade various predators. They, however, can use their burgundy feathers to disguise themselves as some manner of plant or rock and evade their hunters in the forest.",
