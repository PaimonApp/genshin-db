	"description": "An agile and wise soul, endowed since birth with a well-maintained elegance and pride.\nThese cats are conscientious and cautious, elite hunters amongst their kind. Due to humans often delegating the vital task of defense against vermin to them, they are sometimes also called \"watch-leaders.\" And though cats are free animals by nature, these \"watch-leaders\" take their rat-catching duties very seriously. In Liyue, such cats are fondly known as \"Catcher-General Kitty,\" so much so that children's books and toys of this sort are quite popular amongst kids.",
