Ferocious by nature, it will attack from underwater.\nIts evolutionary history in this land precedes even the advent of Sumeru's forest. In the age when gods with beast's faces still had dominion over the world, these creatures were worshiped as gods by humans. Even today, the desert dwellers see their spiny red crowns as relics of ancient deities.",
