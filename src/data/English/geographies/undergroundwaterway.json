The waters here are clean and cool, perfect for taking a break and wash all the ill-fortune accumulated on the way off.\"\n\"There are some gentle elemental creatures nearby who move most slowly, rare beings who have no quarrel with the rest of the world... I drew the waterway on the map. I hope the Traveler can follow it and find this place.\"",
