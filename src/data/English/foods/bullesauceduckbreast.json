	"description": "A meat dish with the fragrant fullness of fruit. After sautéeing the duck breast, slice it and plate the meat before drizzling Bulle Fruit sauce atop it. Crisp skin, sumptuous tender meat, and sauce mingling sweet and sour come together in an ensemble that is a classic Fontainian delicacy.",

		"description": "A meat dish with the fragrant fullness of fruit. The sauce hasn't counteracted the greasiness of the duck at all — in fact, it's given it a bitter edge instead. The appetite evoked upon seeing it presented so beautifully seems to have disappeared equally as suddenly after your first bite."

		"description": "A meat dish with the fragrant fullness of fruit. The citrusy flavor of tangerine gives the succulent duck a unique, fresh sweetness. It's so irresistibly delicious that you can barely stop yourself from reaching for the next piece even before you've swallowed the last one. No matter how much Fontaine's food culture has evolved over the years, it's no surprise that this dish has always kept its place among the classics."
