This is almost like a small, lovely, and intricate artwork, with its pale red outer coat covering the feelings that the young maiden began to harbor from that moment on. If one had the honor of enjoying such a treat while having tea with a princess as graceful and noble as a white heron, one would surely yearn to have that moment stretch into eternity.",
