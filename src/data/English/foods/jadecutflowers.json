	"description": "Lan Yan's specialty. Before you, a young girl lowers her head, focused on weaving something with great care... In no time at all, a delicate rattan bowl appears in your hands, holding exquisite silver swallows and fragrant pastries. The girl's sincere, innocent smile seems almost like a spell, urging you to take a bite, and as you do, the flavors linger delightfully on your palate.",
