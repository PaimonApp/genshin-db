The Forest Watcher personally picked out these edible mushrooms â€” not only the common ones but also a few mysterious-looking shrooms that you have never seen before. No condiments were added, for the limelight should go to the ingredients' unmarred freshness. It must have taken him quite some time to prepare this delicious dish.",
