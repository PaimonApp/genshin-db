	"description": "Albedo's specialty. The fruits and vegetables are laid out like grass, and they stand tall like trees. In this miniature world-in-a-plate, you circle the mottled city wall, follow brown alleys, and enter the light orange castle. A sweet, tender taste then bursts forth like a blooming flower. You open your eyes. There is a smile in the white-haired prince's eyes.",
