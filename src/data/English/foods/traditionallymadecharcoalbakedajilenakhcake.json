	"description": "Faruzan's specialty. The dark and sweet cake, lying as it does atop a minty-green sauce bed, almost looks like some enigmatic mechanism. Your hesitation must have somehow reached Faruzan, for she then straightened up to assertively reassure you that this was a traditional dish in Sumeru and that its flavor is guaranteed. But you can't help wondering... Is it really a \"traditional\" dish that catered to the tastes of Sumeru people a hundred years ago?",
