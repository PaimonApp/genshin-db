Amongst the ingredients here is the new tea, Dipped Dew, delivered from Qiaoying Village right to the Teahouse, which was then quickly fried together with freshly-caught river shrimp. The look is sightly, the scent of distant tea, and the taste both tender and springy... Wait a moment. Why's she coming over with that plate of chilli?",
