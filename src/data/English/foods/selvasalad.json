	"description": "An Aranara-style salad that Paimon drained her brain juice dry to improve. It is, in fact, a rather traditional recipe in Sumeru. Fresh and crispy Zaytun Peach slices are mixed with gently-squeezed Sumeru Roses, which adds a touch of distinctive flavor. Mint is used instead of sugar to avoid getting a sickening sweetness. A refreshing dish that pleases both the eyes and the nose.",

Ripe — \"slightly fermented\" to be more precise — Zaytun Peaches give off a bizarre smell. And this is to say nothing of the disproportionate use of mints and roses..."

Crispy and juicy Zaytun Peaches are served with fresh mints and blooming roses. This delicacy tastes refreshingly sweet and feels pleasantly cool on the tongue — This must be \"the Taste of Happiness,\" as Aranara say."
