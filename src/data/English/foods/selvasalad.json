	"description": "An Aranara-style salad that Paimon drained her brain juice dry to improve. It is, in fact, a rather traditional recipe in Sumeru. Fresh and crispy Zaytun Peach slices are mixed with gently-squeezed Sumeru Roses, which adds a touch of distinctive flavor. Mint is used instead of sugar to avoid getting a sickening sweetness. A refreshing dish that pleases both the eyes and the nose.",

Ripe — \"slightly fermented\" to be more precise — Zaytun Peaches give off a bizarre smell. And this is to say nothing of the disproportionate use of mints and roses..."

Crispy and juicy Zaytun Peaches are served with fresh mints and blooming roses.
