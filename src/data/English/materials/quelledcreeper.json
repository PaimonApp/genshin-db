	"description": "The final coalesced form of the Dendro Hypostasis. The tough vines protect a pure cubic elemental crystal.\nDendro defies any common logic yet exists in perfect harmony with life. Elemental Hypostases, on the contrary, are most distant in appearance to all living beings. The combination of these two should probably never have appeared in this world. It is said that such elemental hypostases have the intelligence to \"learn\" and have thus understood the colors and dreams of the forest, a process that has transformed them into this shape over thousands of years.",
